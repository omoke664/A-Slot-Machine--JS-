# A-Slot-Machine--JS-
I am trying to create a slot machine game using Java Script that typically has three reels that spin when a button is pushed and I am still on the early stages of coding so I really haven't thought through everything but I'm hoping to collaborate with anyone interested in helping me finish it.
